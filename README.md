# dotnetTemplate
A .NET 8+ universal template for building any app using a DDD approach.

This template will generate all the necessary projects for building your app. A console project with a Dockerfile will be created by default, but you can of course create any presentation-type project here (web, API, desktop, mobile, etc.) and add references to all other projects.

When creating a new single app solution with an IDE (in opposition to a solution containing a Server and Client app for instance), check "Put solution and project in the same directory" since the template will create multiple projects. You will get a cleaner folder structure this way.
