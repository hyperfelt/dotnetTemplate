# dotnetTemplate
A .NET 8+ universal template for building any app using a DDD-driven approach.

This template will generate all the necessary projects for building your app. A console project with a Dockerfile will be created by default, but you can of course create any presentation-type project here (web, API, desktop, mobile, etc.) and add references to all other projects.
